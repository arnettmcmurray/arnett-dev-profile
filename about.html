            <h2>Who is Arnett?</h2>

            <p>
              I'm the kind of guy who will fix your code, season your cast iron,
              and still find time to walk the dog before sunrise. A former chef
              who worked in Michelin-starred kitchens, I now write software with
              the same precision I once plated foie gras — clean, intentional,
              and bold.
            </p>

            <p>
              I grew up on the North Side of Chicago, raised in the city’s
              rhythm and grit. I’ve run soccer fields, coached youth sports, and
              rebuilt my backyard with nothing but a few chains, some lumber,
              and stubbornness. These days, I’m more likely to be debugging
              JavaScript or fine-tuning a SQL query, but I bring that same
              discipline and hustle to every project I touch.
            </p>

            <p>
              I don’t just study systems — I build them. Whether it's a terminal
              HUD, a portfolio site, or a full-stack application, I want things
              to work well and look sharp. I'm obsessed with the process and
              always curious about the "why" behind the "what."
            </p>

            <p>
              I’ve helped others navigate complicated life situations and taught
              myself how to untangle problems most people run from. That
              perspective fuels my work — thoughtful, resilient, and unafraid to
              go deep where others quit.
            </p>

            <p>
              Outside the screen glow, you’ll find me grilling in the yard,
              working on DIY builds, or taking inspiration from the chaos that
              my pets bring into my workspace. I’m building a career that blends
              creativity, logic, and integrity — one clean line of code at a
              time.
